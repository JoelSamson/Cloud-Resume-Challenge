# 10. Python

Challenge - You will need to write a bit of code in the Lambda function; you could use more Javascript, but it would be better for our purposes to explore Python – a common language used in back-end programs and scripts – and its boto3 library for AWS. Here is a good, free Python tutorial.
#

This AWS Lambda function is designed to increment the view count in a DynamoDB table named 'cloudresume'. The function is triggered by an event which is visiting a page stored in a s3 bucket, and it uses the `boto3` library to interact with AWS services.

## Prerequisites
- AWS account with Lambda and DynamoDB set up
- IAM role with permissions to read and write to DynamoDB

## Setup
1. Create a DynamoDB table named 'cloudresume' with a primary key 'id' of type String.
2. Create an IAM role for your Lambda function with the necessary permissions for DynamoDB.
3. Create a new Lambda function in the AWS Lambda console.
4. Configure the Lambda function to use the IAM role created in step 2.
5. Copy and paste the provided Python code into the Lambda function editor.
6. Save the Lambda function.

## Function Explanation
- The Lambda function uses the `boto3` library to create a connection to DynamoDB.
- It retrieves the item with the key 'id' equal to '1' from the 'cloudresume' table.
- It increments the 'views' attribute of the retrieved item.
- The updated item is then put back into the DynamoDB table.

## Trigger
Configure an appropriate trigger for the Lambda function, such as an API Gateway, to invoke the function and trigger the view count increment. In my project we use a feature called Funtion URL in AWS Lamda.

## Testing
You can test the Lambda function by invoking it manually from the AWS Lambda console. Verify that the view count in the DynamoDB table increases with each visit to the page stored in the S3 bucket.

##CODE

```python
import json
import boto3

awsService = boto3.resource('dynamodb')
table = awsService.Table('cloudresume')

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # TODO implement
    response = table.get_item(Key={
        'id':'1'
    })
    views = response['Item']['views']
    views = views + 1
    print(views)
    response = table.put_item(Item={
        'id':'1',
        'views': views
    })
    return views
```
