# 8. DynamoDB

Challenge - The visitor counter will need to retrieve and update its count in a database somewhere. I suggest you use Amazon’s DynamoDB for this. (Use on-demand pricing for the database and you’ll pay essentially nothing, unless you store or retrieve much more data than this project requires.) Here is a great free course on DynamoDB.

To integrate a visitor counter with Amazon DynamoDB, we'll create a simple backend API using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to handle the database interactions. Here's a high-level overview of the steps:

## Step 1: Setting Up DynamoDB 

1. **Create a DynamoDB Table:**
   - Go to the [Amazon DynamoDB Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/).
   - Click on "Create table."
   - Enter a table name (e.g., `cloudresume`).
   - Set the primary key as `id` (String).
   - Click on "Create."

   - Now we need to add items into the table. Go into cloud resume. Press Action and Create Item

   - Put value 1 for the primary key
   - Select Add nre Attribute and select Number
   - Give Attribute name as `views` and value as 1.

   - Create Item
   - We have successfully created the dynamoDB table
