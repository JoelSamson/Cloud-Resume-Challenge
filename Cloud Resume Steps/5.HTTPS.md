# HTTPS

Here we want to create an Amazon CloudFront distribution and leverage the settings to enable HTTPS. Additionally, we copy the CloudFront distribution policy and apply it to the S3 bucket hosting the resume. Here's a guide on how to achieve this:

## Step 1: Create Amazon CloudFront Distribution with HTTPS

1. Go to the [Amazon CloudFront Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/).

2. Click on "Create Distribution."

3. In the "Origin Setting" section, choose your S3 bucket as the "Origin Domain Name. Ours is joel-cloud-resume-challenge.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com

4. Select "Origin accessInfo" as Origin access control settings (recommended)
                                 Bucket can restrict access to only CloudFront.

6. Under default cache Behaviour we select for the setting
                        Viewer protocol policy
                        HTTPS only

7. Once the distribution is created, note down the CloudFront domain name.

## Step 2: Copy CloudFront Distribution Policy

1. In the CloudFront Console, navigate to the distribution you created.

2. In the distribution settings, find and click on the "Distribution Settings" tab.

3. Scroll down to the "Access Control" section.

4. Click on "Edit" next to "Bucket Policy."

5. Copy the existing bucket policy.

   

## Step 3: Apply CloudFront Policy to S3 Bucket

1. Go to the [Amazon S3 Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/).

2. Navigate to the bucket hosting your resume.

3. In the bucket settings, go to the "Permissions" tab.

4. Click on "Bucket Policy."

5. Paste the CloudFront distribution policy you copied earlier.

6. Save the changes.

## Step 4: Test the Resume Access with HTTPS

1. After the changes have propagated, access your resume using the CloudFront domain (e.g., `https://drlwn5w8rddjn.cloudfront.net`).

2. Ensure that the connection is secure and that HTTPS is enabled.

By copying the CloudFront distribution policy to your S3 bucket, you ensure that the security settings configured for CloudFront are applied to the S3 bucket as well.
