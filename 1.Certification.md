## Certification
Your resume needs to have the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification on it. This is an introductory certification that orients you on the industry-leading AWS cloud – if you have a more advanced AWS cert, that’s fine but not expected. You can sit this exam online for $100 USD. A Cloud Guru offers exam prep resources.
