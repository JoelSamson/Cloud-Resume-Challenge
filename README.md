# My Cloud Resume Challenge

Welcome to my Cloud Resume Challenge showcase! I've successfully completed the challenge, and here's how I went about it.

## Certification

### AWS Cloud Practitioner Certified

I've proudly included the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification on my resume. This certification has given me a solid foundation in the AWS cloud. [You can look at my certification here.](https://www.credly.com/badges/2e4f93ef-b22d-4083-b70b-ef081f17629a/public_url).

## HTML

I crafted my resume using HTML to provide a clean and structured layout. It is made to give you my information at a quick glance and redirect you to important links to connect with me. This is a simple Portfolio Card website.


## CSS

To enhance the visual appeal of my resume, I applied some styling using CSS. While I'm not a designer, I believe the styling adds a professional touch. 

Heres a view of the website till this point:

You can use my layout to personalise your website too.
