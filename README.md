# My Cloud Resume Challenge

Welcome to my Cloud Resume Challenge showcase! I've successfully completed the challenge, and here's how I went about it.

This repository showcases my implementation of the Cloud Resume Challenge. The challenge is an excellent opportunity to demonstrate proficiency in various AWS services and technologies while building a cloud-based resume.

## Project Overview

The Cloud Resume Challenge project includes the following components:

### 1. Resume Website

The heart of the project is a dynamic and responsive resume website hosted on AWS. It highlights my skills, experiences, and projects, providing a comprehensive overview for potential employers.

### 2. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

To ensure reproducibility and scalability, the project utilizes Infrastructure as Code. AWS CloudFormation templates are employed to define and provision the necessary infrastructure.

### 3. AWS Services Used

- **Amazon S3**: Hosting static website assets.
- **Amazon CloudFront**: Content delivery network for improved website performance.
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless functions for handling form submissions or other server-side logic.
- **Amazon API Gateway**: Creating APIs to interact with Lambda functions.
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: Storing data such as form submissions or other dynamic content.
- **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)**: Managing permissions and access control.
- **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)**: Securely managing SSL/TLS certificates for HTTPS.

### 4. Languages and Technologies

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Front-end development for the resume website.
- **Python**: Used for Lambda functions and server-side scripting.
- **AWS CloudFormation**: YAML/JSON templates for defining infrastructure.
