# 4.Static Website Hosting

Challenge - Your HTML resume should be deployed online as an Amazon S3 static website. Services like Netlify and GitHub Pages are great and I would normally recommend them for personal static site deployments, but they make things a little too abstract for our purposes here. Use S3.

## Static website hosting

## Deploying My Resume on Amazon S3

I've successfully deployed my HTML resume as a static website using Amazon S3. Here's a brief guide on how I accomplished this:

## Step 1: Set Up an Amazon S3 Bucket

1. Go to the [Amazon S3 Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/).

2. Click on "Create bucket."

3. Provide a unique and meaningful name for your bucket, such as "your-name-resume-bucket."

4. Choose the AWS region that is most suitable for you.

5. Click through the remaining settings, keeping the defaults, and create the bucket.

   After creating we can see that our bucket is present in the list.

2. Select and upload your HTML and CSS files. Ensure that your main HTML file is named something like "index.html" to serve as the default entry point.

3. Once uploaded, make sure the files are set to public access. Select each file, go to the "Actions" dropdown, and click on "Make public."

   or

   You can go to cloud front


## Step 3: Enable Static Website Hosting (Doesnt need to be done)

1. In your S3 bucket, go to the "Properties" tab.

2. Scroll down to the "Static website hosting" section.

3. Click on "Edit."

4. Choose "Use this bucket to host a website."

5. Specify your main HTML file (e.g., "index.html") as the Index document.

6. Click "Save changes."

## Step 4: Access Your Website Endpoint

1. In the "Static website hosting" section, note the "Endpoint" URL. This is the URL where your resume will be hosted.

2. It may take a few minutes for the changes to propagate. Once done, you can visit the provided Endpoint URL in a web browser to view your deployed resume.

   Try to access it — you’ll see an error come up. Why are we getting this error? Because public access has been disabled. Don’t worry, we’ll be fixing it soon Using Cloud front.
