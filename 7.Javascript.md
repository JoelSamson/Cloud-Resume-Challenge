# Adding a Visitor Counter to Your Resume with JavaScript

To implement a visitor counter on your resume webpage, you can use JavaScript to update and display the count dynamically. Here's a simple example to help you get started:

## Step 7: Implementing the Visitor Counter

1. Open your HTML file (e.g., `index.html`) and add the following script within the `<body>` tag:

```html

 <div class="followers count">
          <div class="follow_count count_value">ðŸ‘€:</div>
          Visited
        </div>
```

2. Create a new JavaScript file (e.g., `script.js`) and add the following code:

```javascript
const count=document.querySelector(".count_value");

async function counter(){
    let response=await fetch("");
    let data = await response.json();
    count.innerHTML=`${data}`;
}
counter();
```

3. Save the changes and ensure that both the HTML and JavaScript files are in the same directory.

4. Update the CloudFront distribution to invalidate the cache or wait for the cache to expire.

5. Access your resume webpage, and you should see the visitor counter updating periodically.

This example uses a simple interval to simulate an increase in visitor count every 5 seconds. In a real-world scenario, you would fetch the count from a server or database.

Feel free to customize the interval, update logic, or integrate with a backend service for a more accurate visitor count.
